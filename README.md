# PythonConversion
# I chose Python using IDLE. It wasnt too difficult to set up. Its a higher level language than C# or Java. It is a strongly typed language that is both compiled and interpreted. I chose this language since its very popular with a very wide range of uses, including mobile applications. It may not be the number one for mobile applications, but its uses for so many things in the industry made me want to learn it. I mainly watched youtube videos from CSDojo to learn to convert the syntax.
